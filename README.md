An unambitious Bevy plugin for persisting multiple Bevy `Resource`s into a single preferences file, suitable for small projects like jam games.

- Persists to a single `ron` file
- Does IO in Bevy's async task pool
- WASM compatible

## Usage

- Derive `Prefs` on a `struct` with members that are `Resource`s you want to be saved
- Simply modify your `Resource`s to initiate a save
- Write code that reacts to those `Resource`s changing, if you want

See [examples/prefs.rs](./bevy_simple_prefs/examples/prefs.rs)

## Contributing

Please feel free to open a PR, but keep in mind this project's goals. This is meant to be a very lightweight crate. There should be zero additional dependencies on other Bevy ecosystem crates.

Please keep PRs small and scoped to a single feature or fix.
